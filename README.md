# **DocuGenius: AI-Powered Code Documentation Generator**

**DocuGenius is a smart tool that automatically generates clear, comprehensive, and maintainable documentation for your codebases using the power of Artificial Intelligence.** Say goodbye to the tedious task of writing docs and let AI do the heavy lifting, so you can focus on what you do best: coding.

## **üöÄ The Problem**

In the fast-paced world of software development, documentation is often an afterthought. It's time-consuming to write, difficult to maintain, and quickly becomes outdated. This leads to:

* **Increased onboarding time** for new developers.  
* **Difficulty in maintaining and scaling** complex projects.  
* **Knowledge silos** where information is held by only a few team members.  
* **Inconsistent documentation quality** across the project.

## **‚ú® The Solution**

DocuGenius tackles this problem head-on by leveraging cutting-edge AI to analyze your code and generate high-quality documentation automatically.

It connects directly to your GitHub repositories, analyzes the structure, functions, classes, and logic of your code, and produces human-readable documentation in Markdown format. The goal is to make documentation a seamless and integrated part of the development lifecycle, not a chore.

## **üåü Key Features**

### **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**

* **GitHub Integration:** Securely connect your GitHub account and select repositories for documentation.  
* **Code Analysis Engine:** Statically analyze code to understand functions, classes, parameters, return values, and dependencies.  
* **AI-Powered Generation:** Use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate explanations for complex code blocks.  
* **Markdown Output:** Generate clean, well-formatted Markdown files for your documentation.  
* **Web-Based Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface to manage your projects and view the generated docs.  
* **Initial Language Support:** Robust support for JavaScript and TypeScript.

### **Future Roadmap**

* **Multi-Language Support:** Extend analysis to Python, Java, Go, C\#, and more.  
* **In-line Comment Generation:** Suggest and insert JSDoc/TSDoc style comments directly into your code.  
* **Customizable Templates:** Allow users to define their own templates for the documentation output.  
* **CI/CD Integration:** Automatically update documentation on every push or pull request via GitHub Actions.  
* **Team Collaboration:** Allow multiple users from a team to collaborate on documentation projects.  
* **Export Formats:** Export documentation to HTML, PDF, or integrate with platforms like Confluence.

## **üèóÔ∏è High-Level Architecture**

The system is designed to be decoupled and scalable, with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend, backend, and the AI processing pipeline.

1\. User connects GitHub repo via Frontend.  
   |  
   v  
2\. Frontend sends request to Backend API.  
   |  
   v  
3\. Backend API authenticates, saves project info, and creates a new job.  
   |  
   v  
4\. Job is added to a BullMQ Queue (e.g., 'code-analysis').  
   |  
   v  
5\. A separate Worker process picks up the job from the queue.  
   |  
   v  
6\. Worker clones the repo, analyzes the code structure, and prepares prompts.  
   |  
   v  
7\. Worker sends prompts to the AI Service (e.g., OpenAI via LangChain.js).  
   |  
   v  
8\. AI Service returns generated documentation text.  
   |  
   v  
9\. Worker formats the text into Markdown and saves it to the Database.  
   |  
   v  
10\. Frontend polls for job completion or receives a notification (e.g., via WebSockets).  
    |  
    v  
11\. User views the generated documentation on their dashboard.
